# Group 1 - River Runner Project

As a group of developers, we want to create an website that helps users find real-time water conditions and weather data from the United States Geological Survey and Openweather.org.  

This is to help them plan out their water related activities (ex. rafting) in Oregon.

## Accepted Criteria

It's done when both API's are fully functioning.

It's done when users are be able to input their location and successfully access data from locations all over Oregon.

It's done when users can select a river in order to see its current weather conditions.

It's done when users can view their past searches.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
